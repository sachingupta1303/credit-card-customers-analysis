# credit-card-customers-analysis


## Overview
This project analyzes credit card customer data to gain insights into customer behavior, segment them into groups, and predict churn using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset (`credit_card_customers.csv`).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis, visualization, and modeling.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing, segmentation, and prediction.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/credit-card-customers-analysis.git
   cd credit-card-customers-analysis
   ```
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebooks or scripts in their respective folders.

## Findings and Insights
- **Demographics**: Majority of the customers are aged between 35-55 and have an income category of `50K-100K`.
- **Segmentation**: K-Means clustering identified distinct customer segments based on credit usage and demographics.
- **Churn Prediction**: A Random Forest classifier achieved an accuracy of XX% and an AUC score of YY.

## Technologies Used
- Python: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
- Version Control: Git and GitHub
